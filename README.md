## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download it:

```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd unzipAndClean
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash

```

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place `unzipAndClean` folder **inside the parent folder** containing your numbered subfolders (e.g., `example folder`).
2. Run the script:

```bash
node unzipAndClean.js
```

3. The script will scan all subfolders (except `unzipAndClean` itself), extract ZIP files, and delete them after extraction.

## 🗑 Notes

* **Do not commit `node_modules`** to GitHub. `.gitignore` handles it.
* If using PowerShell and get warnings about execution policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

* LF/CRLF warnings in Git are normal on Windows. `.gitignore` prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.
